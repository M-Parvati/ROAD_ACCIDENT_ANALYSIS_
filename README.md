# REQUIREMENT :

Clients wants to create a ROAD ACCIDENT dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 
so that they can have Insights on below requirements –

• Primary KPI – Total casualties and Total aacident values for current year and YOY growth.

• Priamry KPI – Total casualties by accident severity for current year and YOY growth.

• Secondary KPI – Total casualties with respect to vehicle type for current year.

• Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for current year and previous year.

• Casualties by road type for current year.

• Current year casualties by area /Location & by day/night.

• Total casualties and total accidents by location.

# STAKEHOLDERS : 

• Ministry of transport

• Road transport department

• Police force

• Emergency service department

• Road safety corps

• Transport Operators

• Traffic management agencies

• Public

• Media

# POWER BI FUNCTIONALITIES :

• How to connect to raw data / flat file.

• Data cleaning in power query.

• Data processing.

• Time Intelligence function / calendar date table in power bi.

• Data modelling (Relationship between multiple tables).

• YTD and YOY growth calculations using DAX.

• KPI and advanced KPI generations.

• Creating custom columns and measures in the reports.

• Importing images.

• Creating different charts and generating insights.

# INSIGHTS :

• The worsening trend of road accidents and fatalities demands immediate attention and 
intervention in road safety measures.

• Fatal accidents remain a major contributor to casualties.

• Two-wheelers continue to be highly vulnerable.

• Seasonal factors such as festivals, vacations, and adverse weather conditions may 
contribute to higher accident rates during these months.

• Road design improvements, including better speed regulation and road safety features, are critical 
on highways to prevent fatalities.

• Some areas may have fewer accidents, but their severity is disproportionately high. 

• The 8.5% increase in accidents and 10.2% rise in casualties between 2021 and 2022 reflect worsening 
road safety trends, signaling the need for comprehensive safety reforms and initiatives.

• Accidents involving heavy vehicles are more likely to occur during nighttime hours, possibly due to 
fatigue and visibility issues. 


# Actionable Recommendations -

• Implement Focused Safety Measures in high-risk zones (e.g., City X, highways).

• Improve Nighttime Safety by increasing road lighting and patrols, especially in 
areas with a high percentage of accidents occurring after dark.

• Target Two-Wheelers with specialized safety campaigns and road design changes (e.g., dedicated lanes).

• Address Seasonal Traffic Surges by improving road infrastructure and traffic
management during peak months (June, December).

• Monitor High-Risk Vehicles and implement additional safety measures, such as mandatory 
rest breaks for drivers of heavy vehicles at night.


# Conclusion :

• This report reveals several critical trends and insights from the road accident data 
of 2021 and 2022.

• By focusing on high-risk areas, specific vehicle types, and time-based patterns,
effective road safety strategies can be developed to reduce accidents and fatalities in 
the coming years.


# Visualizations :

• KPI Visuals: Display total accidents, casualties, and YOY growth using KPI visuals.

• Trend Charts: Use line charts to show accident trends over time, with filters for vehicle type and road type.

• Heatmaps/Maps: Display accident hotspots using location-based maps, highlighting areas with high accident and casualty rates.
